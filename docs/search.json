She is also interested in the evolutionary ecology of fish, in particular how fishing affects the population structure and size distribution of fish with complex life histories.\nhttps://www.tcd.ie/tceh/people/carolina.php\n\n\n\nFreddie Heather\nWrites R code and runs models\n\n\n\nMatt Testoni\n\n\n\nNils Krueck\nSenior Lecturer at IMAS studying marine population dynamics and data-poor fisheries. Nils is interested in a broad range of research projects on the ecology and management of marine species in Australia, southeast Asia and beyond. His primary area of expertise is area-based marine management, specifically the impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs) on both ecosystems and people. Over recent years, Nils has started working more intensively on size frequency distributions in natural and fished populations, and how a better understanding of size frequency distributions can help assess the status and appropriate management of data-poor fishery species.\n\n\n\nRowan Trebilco\n\n\n\nSarah Willington\nFor my PhD, I am interested in looking at how fish size distributions are changing with ocean warming. My research uses simulation modelling to look at how changes in growth and mortality affect population size distributions, and comparing these changes to real fish population distributions to gain a better understanding of what is occurring in coastal rocky reef fishes.\n\n\n\nShane Richards\n\n\n\nWanwan Kurniawan\nApplying mathematical and statistical tools, I am very interested to extract more information from fish size data to be used for improving the data-poor stock assessment methods."

However, it is still not clear how temperature might affect growth, size structure or mean sizes in natural populations and we use diverse data sources and simulations to explore that. \n\nUsing underwater visual survey data from Reef Life Survey (https://reeflifesurvey.com/) we show that mean lengths of fish in natural populations can either increase or decrease with temperature changes across space. This temperature driven change in mean length is very strong (3% change per 1C), which means that average fish length on the warm and cool edge of the fish distribution area can be up to 30% different. Moreover, global warming driven changes in average fish size through time are often qualitatively similar, but rate of change is nearly 10 times faster. But this raises many other questions, which we aim to answer below. \nIs the increase in mean size in warmer waters compatible with the temperature size rule, which states that in warmer conditions fish grow to smaller maturation sizes? \nFish size distributions are shaped by rates of growth and mortality, and by using simulation modelling we can manipulate these two parameters to see how population mean and maximum size might change under different temperature conditions. Using these methods we can show that it is possible to get increasing population mean sizes, even though the maximum and asymptotic size may be declining, as predicted by the temperature size rule.\n\n{#sec-size-models-impacts} ## Applying size based models to assess human impacts\n{#sec-historical-shifting-baselines} ## Using historical records to understand shifting baselines\nHistorical data helps us understand the cumulative impact of human activities and minimise the shifting baseline syndrome by estimating the degree to which human activities can alter marine fish populations and ecosystems. We aim to incorporate historical records (oral histories, photographs, newspaper articles, logbooks) for estimating past fish population size distributions at local and regional scales. Examples of the use of historical sources to understand past fisheries dynamics: \n\nChong-Montenegro C, Thurstan RH, Pandolfi JM (2022) Quantifying the historical development of recreational fisheries in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
