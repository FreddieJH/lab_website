<!-- Nils Kruek: Senior Lecturer at IMAS studying marine population dynamics and data-poor fisheries. Nils is interested in a broad range of research projects on the ecology and management of marine species in Australia, southeast Asia and beyond. His primary area of expertise is area-based marine management, specifically the impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs) on both ecosystems and people. Over recent years, Nils has started working more intensively on size frequency distributions in natural and fished populations, and how a better understanding of size frequency distributions can help assess the status and appropriate management of data-poor fishery species. -->

<!-- Sarah Willington: For my PhD, I am interested in looking at how fish size distributions are changing with ocean warming. My research uses simulation modelling to look at how changes in growth and mortality affect population size distributions, and comparing these changes to real fish population distributions to gain a better understanding of what is occurring in coastal rocky reef fishes. -->
